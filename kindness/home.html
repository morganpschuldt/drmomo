<h2>Helping People</h2>

<p>my passion is helping people. When i help people it makes me feel good. I think my mom played a huge part when it comes to me helping people. My mom is the most compassionate person i know. She always makes sure everyone is ok and she does this so much that sometimes she even forgets about herself. i think watching her do this over the years has definitely rubbed off on me.
